### Reddit (Forums Website) Clone

Stack used: MERN - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js

This project comprises a full-stack website where users can browse available forums, and after creating an account they can also write posts and comments.
More emphasis was put on the strcture and layout of the pages, the styling is quite minimalistic.

To try it out, node.js and mongoDB are required. 
After cloning the repo, just fetch the dependencies by running ```npm init``` twice, once in the server folder and once in the client folder, create the database running ```mongosh``` and then ```use redditclone```, and finally, run ```npm start``` first in the server folder and then in the cliend folder.
